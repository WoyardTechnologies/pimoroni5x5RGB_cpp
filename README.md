# pimoroni5x5RGB_cpp

a modified Adafruit library for the IS31FL3731 made to work with the Pimoroni 5x5 RGB LED breakout board\
-**the real work in modifying was done by [u/Jasonic8](https://forums.pimoroni.com/u/Jasonic8)**\
I got their files from here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i2ZUfTKgYsResBc5dZn-SBu3Qsc7nwkl](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i2ZUfTKgYsResBc5dZn-SBu3Qsc7nwkl)\
example sketch attached is also Jasonic8's work\
and of course the original library is made by Adafruit

I just moved and modified some array declarations in the library code which didn't want to compile on my machine.\
perhaps it will be a useful resource for someobody, as provided Pimoroni cpp examples were quite troublesome to use (I never did get them to work)
